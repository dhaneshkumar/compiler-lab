ast.hh, ast.cc :


Changes made in parser.yy :

the following types were added :

-> arithop: representing the arithmetic operators
-> typecast_exp: representing typecasted exressions of the format -"'(' FLOAT ')' relop_expression" OR "'(' FLOAT ')' '(' relop_expression ')'" where FLOAT can be replaced with DOUBLE or INTEGER

-> arith_expression: containing variable/constant/typecast_exp as base definitions as well as the recursive definitions "variable arithop arith_expression" or "constant arithop arith_expression"

-> variable was updated as "NAME" or " '-' NAME"

-> constant was updated as "INTEGER_NUMBER" or "FLOAT_NUMBER"


-> relop_expression got a new expansion :
	"arith_expression"

-> declaration_statement got 2 new expansions :
	FLOAT NAME ';'
	DOUBLE NAME ';'
