Changes made in parser.yy :
all the following new types and definitions added in 2a has been expanded, i.e. rules for their parsing were written.

-> atomic: representing an atomic intity. For e.g> variable, constant and (relop_expression)
-> dataType : representing float, double and integer datatype
-> typecast_exp: representing typecasted exressions of the format - '(' dataType ')' atomic
-> Extended the relop expression by adding more cases
	: atomic
	: relop_expression (+-*/) relop_expression
	: typecast_exp
	: - atomic

-> declaration_statement got 2 new expansions :
	FLOAT NAME ';'
	DOUBLE NAME ';'

Changes made in local-environment.h and local-environment-table.cc
A new class "Eval_Result_Value_Float" has been defined and declared same as in the lines of "Eval_Result_Value_Int" to vcater to float numbers
since the types of variables possible is int and float, all the functions and classes whose members/dependencies were int variable has now become a struct "dtype"
which has a float and an int data member to cater to int and floating types respectively.
All the functions that had a dependency on the fata-type had "int" previously. now they have been updated to handle the struct.
e.g. now the symbol table contains structs instead of ints and/or floats

Changes made in ast.cc :
Number_Ast has been updated to accomodate float variables.
Evaluate of Name_Ast was updated to cater for typecasted variables
Evaluate of Relational_Expr_Ast was updated to cater to unary negatives,arithemtic expressions for both integer variables and floating point variables
